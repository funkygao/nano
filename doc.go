// Package nano provides a pure Go implementation of the Scalability
// Protocols.  These are more familiarily known as "nanomsg" which is the
// C-based software package that is also their reference implementation.
//
// These protocols facilitate the rapid creation of applications which
// rely on multiple participants in sometimes complex communications
// topologies, including Request/Reply, Publish/Subscribe, Push/Pull,
// Surveyor/Respondant, etc.

// For more information, see www.nanomsg.org.
